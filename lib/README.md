# Libraries
You will be needing the following libraries in order for the bot to compile.

#### File Structure
In order for the program to compile correctly your libraries should be placed like this:

`(cppbot)/lib/sleepy-discord` < with all of the sleepy-discord stuff in there. (Needs to be the
develop branch otherwise the bot won't work)

`(cppbot)/lib/json.hpp` < the JSON header file

`(cppbot)` is the root directory of the C++ bot.
