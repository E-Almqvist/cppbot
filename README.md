## cppbot
Discord bot written in C++ with the SleepyDiscord library. You can customize it as you like and
create custom bot commands!

![Bot Demo](demo/discordbot.gif)

### Installation 
Installing and compiling the bot is easy with the install script. 

`wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/E-Almqvist/cppbot/master/install.sh && sudo bash install.sh /path/to/bot BOT_NAME`

Where `/path/to/bot` needs to be an existing directory and `BOT_NAME` will be the bots name. 
You will also need *git*, *sudo* and *wget* to install the bot. You will need *cmake*, *GCC* (compiler) and *make* in order to compile the bot. 

### Manual Installation
Literally just clone the repository and compile everything yourself. 

### Setup 
Go into your bots directory and create two files `bot.id` and `bot.token` in `Builds/`.
Then go to your Discord application and copy your bots secret token and put it into `Builds/bot.token`.
Then put your bots ID into `Builds/bot.id`. **Filenames are case-sensitive!**
#### Manual Installation Setup
Copy your bots token and ID and put them into their respective file (`bot.id` and `bot.token`).
These files should be located where you compiled the bot.

### Usage
If you installed the bot via the installation script then you can start the bot via the start
script. The start script is located in the bots root directory.
###### Example:
`sudo sh start.sh`

### Configuration
You can create custom bot commands in the config file (`Builds/config.json`).
**DO NOT REMOVE ANY VARIABLES (other than commands) IN THE FILE, CHANGE ONLY THE VALUES!**
The configuration is written in JSON. You can read more about JSON syntax here: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/json/json_syntax.htm

**Note:** Commands with no description will not be displayed with the help command.
